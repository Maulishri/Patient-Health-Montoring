# Patient-Health-Montoring

Hello everyone, 

In this era of automation and Interconnecting things via the internet, have you ever wondered, that what if this automation is brought about in the Medical field??  This project is basically a Patient Monitoring system, built for the convenience of the patient and the doctor as well.

## Idea and Prototype

The plan is to send the data about the patient, like heart rate, and body temperature directly to the doctor using an app. When the conditions that we are monitoring, start getting abnormal, an alert is sent to the doctorâ€™s phone! A mobile prototype of the same is as under -

Using this system, we can reduce the number of people required around the patient and the person in charge can be kept updated 24/7. 

## Main components of the Project

1. **Heart rate sensor**- To keep a check on the patient's heart rate
2. **LM-35 sesnor** - To read the patient's body temperature
3. **Bluetooth module** - To send data from sensors to app
4. **Blynk App** - For better visualization

## Future Scope
If this is implemented on a large scale, a database can be created with data of multiple patients on a single app, and patient priority can be decided by the app algorithm.

# Patient-Health-Montoring

Hello everyone, 

In this era of automation and Interconnecting things via the internet, have you ever wondered, that what if this automation is brought about in the Medical field??  This project is basically a Patient Monitoring system, built for the convenience of the patient and the doctor as well.
The plan is to send the data about the patient, like heart rate, and body temperature directly to the doctor using an app.
And when the conditions that we are monitoring, start getting abnormal, an alert is sent to the doctorâ€™s phone. 
Using this system, we can reduce the number of people required around the patient and the person in charge can be kept updated 24/7. 
I have used basic sensors like the heart rate sensor and the LM-35 temperature sensor. The data is being updated using the Bluetooth module using Blynk app.

If this is implemented on a large scale, a database can be created with data of multiple patients on a single app, and patient priority can be decided by the app algorithm.
